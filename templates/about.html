    <p>
        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest
        in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when
        Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
        Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
        Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
        action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned
        to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>
                Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in
                his youth, Thorin and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug,
                in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was demonstrated at the Battle
                of Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's
                East-gate, and at some point in the battle, his shield broke, and, using an oaken tree branch found on
                the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which remained with him even in death.

            <p>
                Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother, Dís. They were also
                nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing
                feature was his long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

            <h3>Oin</h3>
            <p>
                Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was
                Fundin, the father of Balin and Dwalin.
                Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined Thorin's
                company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves
                who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin
                were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company, as they were the most skilled of the
                group. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain
                with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of the company of Thorin.

            <h3>Gloin</h3>
            <p>
                Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin
                and younger brother of Óin.
                In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of
                the Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old.
                In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In
                March of TA 2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin
                to reclaim Erebor, so that Smaug wouldn't ally with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned Hobbits, Glóin
                referred them as "simpletons" and also said that Hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling
                distance of the nakedest dragonet new from the shell".

            <h3>Balin</h3>
            <p>
                Balin was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of Dwalin. He was one of the thirteen
                Dwarves who accompanied Thorin II Oakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain.
                A Dwarf Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Thorin's closest
                friends and advisers. Balin was distantly related to him, and a descendant of the noble House of Durin.
                He later went to re-establish the Dwarf presence in Moria, but within five years it was overcome once
                more by Orcs, and he was killed there along with the rest of his companions.

                Ori lived in Thorin's hall in the northern Blue Mountains for many years, alongside his cousins: Dori
                and Nori. In the year TA 2941, Ori became a member of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin,
                Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the other Dwarves on the quest for the Lonely Mountain, culminating in the
                death of Smaug. Finally, he and the other Dwarves of Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of Five
                Armies in TA 2942, which he survived.

                Before the Quest of Erebor, Dori lived in Thorin's hall in the northern Blue Mountains with Nori and
                Ori. In TA 2941, the three became part of Thorin and Company, befriending Bilbo Baggins and traveling
                with him in search of Smaug's treasure at the Lonely Mountain.

                them. Both shared Bilbo's liking for regular meals. Before the Quest for the Lonely Mountain, Nori lived

                Durin. Most of his familial relations are unclear, and what is known of his parentage is very little. He
                and his family were driven out of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the dragon Smaug, and were forced
                to live in exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked as a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a
                new life at his halls in the Blue Mountains, he continued his life as a toy maker.

                Company across Wilderland to the Lonely Mountain in order to reclaim the Dwarves' treasure from the
                dragon Smaug. Following the dragon's demise, Bofur participated in and survived the Battle of Five
                Armies, receiving his fourteenth share of the treasure as agreed upon.

                Bombur's parentage is unknown. He was the brother of Bofur and cousin of Bifur. Bombur was not of
                Durin's line, although he was descended from the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm. His birth date is unknown,
                though it fell somewhere between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of
                the thirteen "by some fifty years," and, after Thorin was captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli
                was born in TA 2859, and Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the
                quest. Prior to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside Thorin, after the
                loss of Thráin II.

                 Originally called Olórin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar. He was created by Ilúvatar
                 before the Music of the Ainur,[1] and was at the beginning of Time amongst the Ainur who entered into
                 Eä.[2] In his "youth" he became one of the Maiar who served Manwë, Varda, Irmo, and Nienna. He was
                 associated with light and fire, much like Varda,[3] yet his ways often took him to Nienna, from whom he
                 learned pity and patience. He loved the Elves, but walked unseen among them, or wore the guise of an
                 Elf, and sent them fair visions in their hearts that made them wiser. Throughout his life he followed
                 the example of Nienna, talking pity on the sorrows of the Children of Ilúvatar and drawing those who
                 listened to him out of despair.
